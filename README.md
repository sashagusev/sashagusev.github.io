This is the jekyll backbone for http://sashagusev.github.io, I use a stand-alone jekyll installation to allow for additional plugins such as the bibliography.

The design is based on the https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo theme.

These are the build commands that I always forget:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
bundle exec jekyll build --destination ../sashagusev.github.io/
```
